# The Tech Academy Basic C# Projects

This repository contains all my coding projects from my C# course at The Tech Academy. It will include various exercises and assignments that showcase my learning and progress with C# programming concepts, including loops, conditionals, functions, object-oriented programming, and more.

As I progress through the course, I will add new projects to this repository. Please feel free to explore my work and leave feedback.
